# ‚ùó Known issues
- Memory map problems can keep your PC from booting. It is an known issue that has nothing to do with this EFI. It's connected to the motherboard. Feel free to edit ```boot-args``` and delete ```slide=xxx```. However, if memory problem occure (you'll know when it occured if you see some random numbers and Apple Stop sign while booting), you'll have to experiment with this number a bit.
> Motherboard is randomizing Memory Map, so sometimes it will throw an error, and sometimes it will work just fine. Current fix is to keep it at one number (ex. 146) and restart it until it boots. Yikes.

# ‚ùó Works on Sequoia too :) Well...
- Currently it's not possible to enable AppleALC on AMD machines running Sequoia. You should use USB headphones instead / or VoodooHDA (didn't try that).
- CPU Name is wrong, patchable but I'm kinda lazzy right now.
